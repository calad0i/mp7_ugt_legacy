Description of ROMs for LUTs with values for "inverted deltaR square (inv_dr_sq)" of calos

- The values of inv_dr_sq are used in "invariant mass divided by deltaR" conditions (for multiplication with invariant mass).
- Formular for inv_dr_sq values: 1/(deta*0.0435)^2+(dphi*2*PI/144)^2
- ROMs are implemented in BRAMs (36kb).
- Address range splitted in 5 segments for reducing BRAM resources.
- Addresses (8 bit deta_bin & 8 bit dphi_bin) splitted by the maximum value of inv_dr_sq (datawidth of ROM) in a range.
- For calos resulting the following 5 ROMs:
-- ROM 1: 4096x26 (64x64 address bits, 26 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in first segment)
   Address range: deta "00xxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 2: 4096x14 (64x64 address bits, 14 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in second segment)
   Address range: deta "01xxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 3: 4096x12 ...
   Address range: deta "10xxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 4: 4096x11 ...
   Address range: deta "11xxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 5: 4096x14 ...
   Address range: dphi "0100xxxx".
- ROMs are generated with Vivado "managed_ip_project" and stored in ../firmware/ngc
