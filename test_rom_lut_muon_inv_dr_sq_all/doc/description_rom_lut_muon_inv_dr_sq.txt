Description of ROMs for LUTs with values for "inverted deltaR square (inv_dr_sq)" of muons

- The values of inv_dr_sq are used in "invariant mass divided by deltaR" conditions (for multiplication with invariant mass).
- Formular for inv_dr_sq values: 1/(deta*0.0435)^2+(dphi*2*PI/144)^2
- ROMs are implemented in BRAMs (36kb).
- Address range splitted in 6 segments for reducing BRAM resources.
- Addresses (8 bit deta_bin & 8 bit dphi_bin) splitted by the maximum value of inv_dr_sq (datawidth of ROM) in a range.
- For muons resulting the following 6 ROMs:
-- ROM 1: 8192x26 (64x64 address bits, 28 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in first segment)
   Address range: deta "0xxxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 2: 8192x14 (64x64 address bits, 14 databits from maximum value of inv_dr_sq in second segment)
   Address range: deta "1xxxxxxx", dphi "00xxxxxx".
-- ROM 3: 8192x16 ...
   Address range: deta "0xxxxxxx", dphi "01xxxxxx".
-- ROM 4: 8192x14 ...
   Address range: deta "1xxxxxxx", dphi "01xxxxxx".
-- ROM 5: 8192x14 ...
   Address range: deta "0xxxxxxx", dphi "10xxxxxx".
-- ROM 6: 8192x13 ...
   Address range: deta "1xxxxxxx", dphi "10xxxxxx".
- ROMs are generated with Vivado "managed_ip_project" and stored in ../firmware/ngc
